# * Most recent skins are first *

**Disclaimer:** For a lot of my skins, I make custom elements or swap files out for the ones I prefer (such as hitsounds). To preserve the correct intellectual rights, I will *not* be including those files nor will I rehost any skin downloads. The links below are representative of the original skins by the original creators, however, I will note what changes I have made

**Disclaimer 2:** I'm only putting my most used skins here. Any others I use are either private, I don't use them often enough to warrant putting them in this collection, or are old mixed skins I'm not proud of years past making them

Let me know if any of the links break (or if you really want to know how I re/made elements)

Changes:

Cursor and Hitsounds transferred from **Moonshine 2.1**

Removed one combo color (forget the exact hex code, but it's the yellow one as it interferred with my reading due to the new cursor)

Made a separate variant for instafade hitcircles

Changes (a lot this time):

Yellow w/ Pink Trail Cursor from unknown source skin (it's everywhere, not hard to find)

Hitcircles also from an unknown source skin (I recall watching a btmc and koifishu skin competition video and got it from there)

Slider Circle Overlay also also from an unknown source skin (I'm really bad with memorizing shit like this)

100/50/Miss cute faces also also also from an unknown source skin (might be included in one of xooty's skins, look there first)

Hitsounds might be changed? Again, I completely forget

HP bar is customized using the included PSD file

Miss sound is the [bonk meme](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TV5faBBHfkw)

Changes:

"Cursor/Hitcircles/Slider Circle Overlay from an unknown source skin"

Hitsounds probably changed, if so, unknown source skin

HP bar is completely recreated with my own custom Pop Cat art, used as the base for the WhiteCat skin above)

Slider Follow Circle is from Sotarks's skin (99% sure)

"Miss sound is the [bonk meme](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TV5faBBHfkw)"

*Also of note, I have multiple variants of this edited skin. One of which has HuTao lewds. I will not be supplying those files, but with a quick google or reddit search you can probably find them. They are made specifically for this skin, though*
